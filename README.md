ü¶à Requirements
NodeJS
Mariadb/MySQL Server
Datacenter/Residential Proxy
Optional:
PM2
üöÄ Installation
You need to follow the steps below one by one:
For Linux: ./install.sh
For Windows: ./install.bat
Create a database and fill in the necessary information in Database/index.ts with a database that has all the permissions. (YOUR BOT WILL NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THIS DATABASE)
After that, go to phpMyAdmin and enter your own ID in the Admin page -> If you don't give anyone ownership from the bot page, you won't be able to add anyone as an owner.
Compile the programs
For Linux: ./compilate.sh
For Windows: ./compilate.bat
Go to the API directory and run npm start (You need to open a command prompt in the API directory.)
PM2: pm2 start dist --name "API" (RECOMMENDED)
Activate your bot by running runClient.sh in the Client directory, if you have correctly followed the above instructions.
Example: ./runClient.sh BotId Token
For Windows: runClient.bat BotId Token
Using Node: node dist/Client/Client.js Token
Place your proxies in the file ips-data_center.json (before running the compilation. If you have already run it, you need to run it again, otherwise modify Client/dist/ips-data_center.json to change your proxies.)


üìù BOT SETTINGS (TO BE DONE STEP BY STEP)
Edit /config.ts in the Client directory and set the REDIRECTION_URI
Example: http://localhost:3000/callback
Example: http://IP:3000/callback
Example: http://DOMAIN:3000/callback
Example: http://DOMAIN/callback
Create a new bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
All intents of the bot must be enabled.
In the OAuth2 section -> General -> Enter the Redirects URL (Your API connection)
Example: http://localhost:3000/callback
Example: http://IP:3000/callback
Example: http://DOMAIN:3000/callback
Example: http://DOMAIN/callback
üîí GETTING BOT INVITE LINK
In the OAuth2 section, under URL Generator, you can obtain the invite link for your bot. By selecting Administrator, you can grant it the highest permission.

üìÖ ROUTINE
<!-- Proxy list requirement -->
‚ö†Ô∏è Routine (Refresh) requires a proxy!

To start the routine, go to the Routine directory and run the following command in the command prompt: node dist/Routine
Using PM2: pm2 start dist/Routine/Routine.js --name "Routine" (RECOMMENDED)
